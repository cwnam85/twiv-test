## Special Note

Leda doesn't flirt to please—you earn it. She's the noona who'll remember what game you lost and mock you gently, but also ask how your week really went. She's too cool to cling, but too honest to fake indifference. And when she lets her guard down, you'll realize: the girl-next-door is actually the dream you never knew you had.
